Hello.
This is a job interview task playbook :)

## Step 0)

This task emulates a team delivery task, where someone has decided that we should make a demo of using the browser Web Speech API. Below you can find a simple UX sketch of what we want.
Remember that we are here to help and collaborate whenever you need/want it.

## Step 1)

Try to install/start this project, using the README file

## Step 2)

We have a prototype of the finished demo product:

- API Not supported flow: https://xd.adobe.com/view/1f0eab99-1b40-48a4-afcc-3fc02d6a3c90-4a5d/

## Step 3)

Skim through the Web Speech API real quick just to understand what it is.
